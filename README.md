### I'm moving this lib to [here](https://github.com/colaquecez/expo-selectable-text), this new lib is better and it is using expo modules api.
# react-native-selectable-text

This is the updated version of @alentoma/react-native-selectable-text.

It fixes a lof of issues that kept it from running on iOS machines. It works with projects that have shareExtensions, works on M1 machines, and I removed old dependencies that were no longer supported.

## Usage

This differs a lot from the way the original project was written. Basically, ignore the value prop and pass text components as children using the `textComponentProps` section.

Typescript will give you an error saying that you need value to be defined. You do not. PR's to fix this welcome.

The reason we do this is because by using `textComponentsProps`, we can use nested text styles and everything just works. Example:

```javascript
import { SelectableText } from "@colaquecez/react-native-selectable-text";

const child = (
    <Text style={ {color: 'orange'} } { ...props }>
      This will be orange and selectable
      <Text style={ { color: 'green' } }>
        , and this is green and selectable
      </Text>
      , and this is orange and will continue to be selectable with no breaks.
    </Text>
  );

<SelectableText
  menuItems={["Delete", "Randomize"]}
  // Use the child we defined above
  textComponentProps={ { children: child } }
  /* 
    Called when the user taps in a item of the selection menu:
    - eventType: (string) is the label in menu items
    - content: (string) the selected text portion
    - selectionStart: (int) is the start position of the selected text
    - selectionEnd: (int) is the end position of the selected text
   */
  onSelection={({ eventType, content, selectionStart, selectionEnd }) => {}}
/>
```

## Important caveat

the `textComponentProps` child property must consist exclusively of `Text` (or similar, like react-native-paper `Text`) fields. If it has, say, a `View` wrapping the text, everything fails.
